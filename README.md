# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

Here I converted the previous weeks challenge of creating a portfolio, into a similar one using bootstrap. 

It follows a slightly different layout as the challenge guide asks for a different order and new sections.

I also learned a lot during this week and have included that in this week's challenge including but not limited to:

- Hover effects
- Customising Bootstrap with an overriding CSS
- Using Icons to link to socials
- Having a hyperlink that would download my CV to user's PC when clicked.
